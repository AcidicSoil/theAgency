# Enhanced Project Governance Framework

This project implements a comprehensive governance framework to maintain system integrity while accelerating development through structured AI collaboration.

## Framework Overview

The Enhanced Project Governance Framework provides structured guidelines for:

- Decision management with documented decision trees
- Standardized version control workflows
- Effective time management practices
- Knowledge persistence across development sessions
- Stakeholder communication templates
- Systematic error recovery approaches
- Efficient resource allocation
- Continuous improvement processes
- Seamless context switching
- Ethical AI development practices

## Using the Framework

The framework is implemented through a series of MDC (Markdown Configuration) files located in the `.cursor` directory:

### Core Framework Documents

- [Enhanced Governance Framework](.cursor/enhanced-governance-framework.mdc) - Main framework document with comprehensive guidelines
- [Error Decision Tree](.cursor/error-decision-tree.mdc) - Decision tree implementation for handling common errors
- [Framework Review Schedule](.cursor/framework-review-schedule.mdc) - Schedule and criteria for effectiveness reviews

### Template Documents

- [Decision Logs](.cursor/decision-logs.mdc) - Template for tracking key project decisions
- [Error Registry](.cursor/error-registry.mdc) - Registry of encountered errors with resolution steps
- [Knowledge Base](.cursor/knowledge-base.mdc) - Reusable solutions and patterns
- [Project Metrics](.cursor/project-metrics.mdc) - Metrics tracking progress, quality, and performance
- [Toolchain Documentation](.cursor/toolchain.mdc) - Documentation of tools and configurations
- [Data Access Log](.cursor/data-access-log.mdc) - Audit trail for data access operations

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Enhanced Governance Framework](.cursor/enhanced-governance-framework.mdc) to understand the overall approach
2. Use the appropriate template for each governance activity
3. Follow the standardized formats for version control and documentation
4. Implement the error handling decision tree for systematic error resolution
5. Schedule regular framework effectiveness reviews

## Development Workflow

The governance framework integrates with your development workflow through:

1. **Task Management**: Use the `.cursorrules` Scratchpad to track task progress and learnings
2. **Decision Documentation**: Document decisions in `decision-logs.mdc` for future reference
3. **Error Handling**: Apply the decision tree from `error-decision-tree.mdc` to handle errors
4. **Knowledge Sharing**: Contribute reusable solutions to `knowledge-base.mdc`
5. **Performance Tracking**: Update metrics in `project-metrics.mdc` to track progress

## Framework Maintenance

The framework itself should be reviewed periodically as scheduled in `framework-review-schedule.mdc`. The first framework effectiveness review is scheduled for April 23, 2023.
