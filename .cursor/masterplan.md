## Agentic Workflow System (High Priority)

The core of JobHound's automation capability is its agentic workflow system. This multi-agent architecture enables autonomous job hunting with minimal user intervention.

### Agent Types and Responsibilities

1. **Job Scout Agent**
   - Searches job boards based on user criteria
   - Filters potential matches
   - Queues promising opportunities for processing

2. **Analysis Agent**
   - Parses job descriptions using NLP
   - Extracts requirements and qualifications
   - Assesses match quality against user profile

3. **Document Preparation Agent**
   - Customizes resume content for specific jobs
   - Generates tailored cover letters
   - Formats documents according to industry standards

4. **Application Agent**
   - Navigates application portals via browser automation
   - Fills forms with user information
   - Uploads customized documents
   - Handles simple screening questions

5. **Follow-up Agent**
   - Tracks application deadlines
   - Generates follow-up messages
   - Manages calendar for interviews
   - Provides preparation materials

### Workflow Orchestration

The agentic system uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to manage job application workflows:

```
User Profile → Job Scout → Analysis → Match Evaluation → Document Preparation → Application → Follow-up
```

With parallel processing capabilities for handling multiple applications simultaneously.

### Human Oversight and Intervention

- **Approval Checkpoints**: Critical decision points requiring user confirmation
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Automatic escalation to user when agent confidence is low
- **Manual Override**: User can take control at any point in the process
- **Activity Logs**: Transparent tracking of all agent actions

### Implementation Architecture

- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph for agent orchestration
- **Agent Memory**: Structured context storage for maintaining state
- **Tool Integration**: Browser automation, API clients, and document processing tools
- **Monitoring System**: Real-time oversight of agent activities
